This project is an assignment for text to video synthesis.

**Code Explanation:**

Generating Historical Documentary Videos Using AI

This script automates the generation of historical documentary videos on the Mughal Empire using AI-based text generation and text-to-video models. The process consists of two main steps:

1. Generating a JSON file with six scenes, each describing a historical event related to the Mughal Empire.

2. Creating videos from the text using a diffusion-based text-to-video model.

**How to Use This Code**

1. Run the script in Google Colab (since it relies on Google Drive and Hugging Face APIs).

2. Replace "hf_APIKEY" with your actual Hugging Face API key.

3. Execute the script:

It first generates the JSON file with Mughal Empire scene descriptions.

Then, it uses this JSON to create six historical documentary-style videos.

The videos are automatically saved in Google Drive.

**Expected Output**

A JSON file (output_file_1.json) containing six detailed Mughal Empire scene descriptions.

Six AI-generated videos (one per scene) stored in the GeneratedVideos folder in Google Drive.


This method allows efficient text-to-video conversion, making it useful for creating AI-driven historical documentaries, educational content, and storytelling applications.
