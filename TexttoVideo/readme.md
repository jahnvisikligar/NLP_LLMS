This project is an assignment for text to video synthesis.

**How to Use This Code**

1. Run the script in Google Colab (since it relies on Google Drive and Hugging Face APIs).


2. Replace "hf_APIKEY" with your actual Hugging Face API key.


3. Execute the script:

It first generates the JSON file with Mughal Empire scene descriptions.

Then, it uses this JSON to create six historical documentary-style videos.

The videos are automatically saved in Google Drive.

---

**Expected Output**

A JSON file (output_file_1.json) containing six detailed Mughal Empire scene descriptions.

Six AI-generated videos (one per scene) stored in the GeneratedVideos folder in Google Drive.


This method allows efficient text-to-video conversion, making it useful for creating AI-driven historical documentaries, educational content, and storytelling applications.
