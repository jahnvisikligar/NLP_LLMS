## Key Technologies:

* **Langchain**: A Python library that facilitates the development of conversational AI applications. It offers components for document loading, text splitting, prompting, retrieval, memory management, and chain building.
* **ChatOpenAI**: A Langchain wrapper for OpenAI's ChatGPT API, enabling interaction with the powerful GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 model for language generation.
* **FAISS Vectorstore**: An efficient vector similarity search library used to store and retrieve document embeddings generated by OpenAI's API.

## Code Breakdown:

**1. Document Loading and Splitting**:
The code loads the target PDF document using the `PyPDFLoader` and splits it into smaller chunks (pages) using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. This facilitates efficient processing and reduces memory requirements.

**2. Prompt Template (Optional)**:

This section defines a `PromptTemplate` (optional) that can be used to guide the language model's response generation. It provides instructions for context usage, answer length, language, and a concluding phrase.

**3. Embeddings and Vectorstore**:
This block defines the core components of the conversational retrieval chain:

- ChatOpenAI: This instance connects to the `GPT-3.5-turbo-0613` model for generating responses.
- FAISS Vectorstore: Textual content from `pages` is converted into vector embeddings using `OpenAIEmbeddings`. These embeddings are stored efficiently in the `FAISS` vector store.
- Retriever: The `FAISS` vector store is used as a retriever to find the most similar document chunks (pages) to a given query based on their embeddings.
- Memory: A `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps track of the past `k=5`
 
**5. Running the Application**:
This section initializes an empty `chat_history` list and demonstrates how to ask a question (`query`) using the conversational retrieval chain (`qa`). The retrieved answer is stored in the result dictionary.
