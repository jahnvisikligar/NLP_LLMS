## Key Technologies:

* Langchain: A Python library that facilitates the development of conversational AI applications. It offers components for document loading, text splitting, prompting, retrieval, memory management, and chain building.
* ChatOpenAI: A Langchain wrapper for OpenAI's ChatGPT API, enabling interaction with the powerful GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 model for language generation.
* FAISS Vectorstore: An efficient vector similarity search library used to store and retrieve document embeddings generated by OpenAI's API.
Code Breakdown:

**1. Library Imports**:
```
# Uncomment to install required libraries
# !pip install langchain-community pypdf -U langchain-openai faiss-cpu --upgrade langchain python-dotenv

from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
import langchain
```
These lines import necessary libraries for document loading, text splitting, prompting, retrieval using OpenAI's language models, vector storage, and chain building for conversational AI.

**2. Document Loading and Splitting**:

```
# Replace with your PDF path
loader = PyPDFLoader("input_your.pdf")
pages = loader.load_and_split(RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100, length_function=len, is_separator_regex=False))
```
The code loads the target PDF document using the `PyPDFLoader` and splits it into smaller chunks (pages) using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. This facilitates efficient processing and reduces memory requirements.

**3. Prompt Template (Optional)**:

```
template = """
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
Use three sentences maximum. Keep the answer as concise as possible.
Must answer in English language only.
Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer.
{context}
Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:
"""

QA_CHAIN_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["context", "question"], template=template)
```
This section defines a `PromptTemplate` (optional) that can be used to guide the language model's response generation. It provides instructions for context usage, answer length, language, and a concluding phrase.

**4. Embeddings and Vectorstore**:
```
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", temperature=0, openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"),
    retriever=FAISS.from_documents(
        pages, OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    ).as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 2}),
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory(k=5, memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True),
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={"prompt": QA_CHAIN_PROMPT},
    verbose=True)
```
This block defines the core components of the conversational retrieval chain:

- ChatOpenAI: This instance connects to the `GPT-3.5-turbo-0613` model for generating responses.
- FAISS Vectorstore: Textual content from `pages` is converted into vector embeddings using `OpenAIEmbeddings`. These embeddings are stored efficiently in the `FAISS` vector store.
- Retriever: The `FAISS` vector store is used as a retriever to find the most similar document chunks (pages) to a given query based on their embeddings.
- Memory: A `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps track of the past `k=5`
 
**5. Running the Application**:

```
chat_history=[]
query="How to measure quality of AI projects?"
result=qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
result["answer"]
```

This section initializes an empty `chat_history` list and demonstrates how to ask a question (`query`) using the conversational retrieval chain (`qa`). The retrieved answer is stored in the result dictionary.
