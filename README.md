# Natural Language Processing Projects

Welcome to my collection of natural language processing (NLP) projects! This repository contains various projects demonstrating my expertise in text analysis, sentiment analysis, text generation, and more. Each project showcases my ability to leverage NLP techniques to extract insights and knowledge from textual data.

## Project Highlights

- **[Sentiment analysis](https://github.com/jahnvisikligar/NLP_projects/tree/main/Sentiment_analysis)**: The project delves into implementing a pre-trained BERT model and deploying it via the StreamLit framework sourced from the HuggingFace hub, facilitating a seamless integration of advanced NLP techniques into real-world applications.
- **[Chat With PDF using LangChain and OpenAI](https://github.com/jahnvisikligar/NLP_projects/tree/main/Chat_with_PDF)**: The project is the implementation of Langchain framework and OpenAI ChatGPT to perform Q&A with PDF documents.
- **[Text to Video Synthesis](https://github.com/jahnvisikligar/NLP_projects/tree/main/TexttoVideo)**: The project is the implementation of using Text to Video synthesis using open-source models on HuggingFace. It is broken into two parts: the first being text to text generation, which includes creating scenes, and the second part is iteratively running the Text to video model to generate 6 scenes as per the descriptions mentioned in the prompt.
